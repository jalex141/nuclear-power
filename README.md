# Nuclear-power

## Data
I am working with two data sets taken fron kaggle which contain entries for people taking part in various powerlifting events and recording their best marks across three exercises; bench press, squats and dead lift.
kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/ashley93/openpowerlifting

## Objective
The objective for this proyect was to study the performance of participants and the differences among sexes and body-weights

## Hypothesis 
My hypothesis are:
-Men are more phisically gifted than women
-Strength does not scale linearly with weight
-BMR is significantly increased for people who practice strenght training

## Guidelines
I took the datasets from kaggle and prepared them for analysis
Started performing visual and statistical analysis right away
I scrapped some data from the Brazilian federation about body structures for weightlifters
and tried to asimilate some of that data into my dataframe

## Repo 
In here you can find the data and output folders where I store all my input and output dataframes respectively
As well as the src folder with my funtions and pipe-lines
There are some ipynb files that could be stored somewhere but I'd have to change the paths for them so I just don't want to. Note for the future create those files directly in their final destination

## Libraries
### since you asked for them:
pandas
seaborn
numpy
regex
os
sys
